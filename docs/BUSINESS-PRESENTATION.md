## 🎤 PRESENTATION TALKING POINTS

### **For Executive Leadership:**
*"We're building the Bloomberg Terminal of AI training - the go-to platform that every professional needs to stay competitive. We started with recruitment because we know it best, but the model works for any knowledge worker. With 65,000 Randstad employees as our launch pad, we have a built-in distribution advantage that no competitor can match."*

### **For Board/Investors:**
*"The AI training market is projected to hit $10B by 2030. We're capturing early market share with a validated product (used by 1,000+ Randstad employees), proven ROI (15 hours saved per week), and a clear path to $50M ARR in 36 months. Our unfair advantage? Direct access to 65,000 users for product validation and case studies."*

### **For Customers/Prospects:**
*"Your competitors are already using AI to work 10x faster. We help your team catch up in 30 days, not 3 years. Our AI Skills Audit shows you exactly where you're losing time, and our training gets you results in your first week - not months of theory."*

### **For Employees/Team:**
*"We're not just teaching AI. We're building the workforce of the future. Every person who goes through our platform gains skills that make them indispensable. We're giving people job security in an AI-driven world, and that's a mission worth building."*

### **For Partners (Google, Microsoft, etc.):**
*"We're the bridge between your AI models and millions of end users. You build the technology; we teach the world how to use it. Our platform drives adoption, collects feedback, and proves ROI - making your AI products stickier and more valuable."*

## 🔥 THE "STICKY" ELEMENTS (Memorable Takeaways)

### **1. The Big Number**
> **"$152 million per year in productivity gains for Randstad alone. That's not revenue - that's value created in the first year."**

### **2. The Speed Claim**
> **"From zero AI skills to saving 10 hours per week in 30 days. Guaranteed."**

### **3. The Competitive Threat**
> **"Your competitors are using AI to work 10x faster. If you're not training your team, you're falling behind 10 hours per week, every week."**

### **4. The Unfair Advantage**
> **"We have 65,000 Randstad employees as our built-in distribution, testing ground, and case study factory. No competitor has that."**

### **5. The Vision**
> **"Today: AI training for recruiters. Tomorrow: AI training for every knowledge worker. Think LinkedIn Learning, but we actually teach skills that save hours, not just theory."**

### **6. The Proof Point**
> **"Over 1,000 Randstad employees already using it. 80% completion rate. Average 15 hours saved per week. This isn't a pilot - it's working."**

### **7. The Market Opportunity**
> **"$10 billion AI training market by 2030. We're capturing recruitment first ($2B), then expanding to sales, marketing, finance - every function that uses AI."**

### **8. The Exit Story**
> **"Google wants more Gemini users. Microsoft wants more Copilot users. LinkedIn wants learning content. We're the platform they'll acquire to scale adoption."**
