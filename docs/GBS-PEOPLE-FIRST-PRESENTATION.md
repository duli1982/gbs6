```

**Speaker Notes:**
*"Hi everyone. I'm Dusan, and I'm a sourcer - just like many of you. I built this platform because I was frustrated. Frustrated that AI tools exist, but no one was showing us how to actually use them to make our jobs easier. So I built something. And I want to share it with you today."*

# SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (Real Talk)

**Visual:** Split-screen image - Left: person overwhelmed at desk, Right: AI tools logo soup (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

**Headline:** "We Have the Tools. But Not the Skills."

**3 Bullet Points (Large Text):**
- 🤷 **"I don't know where to start with AI"**
- ⏰ **"I'm spending hours on tasks AI could do in minutes"**
- 😰 **"AI feels scary and complicated"**

**Bottom Quote (Large, Italics):**
*"I have ChatGPT open. I just don't know what to type."*
— Every sourcer, everywhere

**Speaker Notes:**
*"Raise your hand if you've felt this. You know AI can help. You've heard the hype. But when you sit down to actually use it, you freeze. You don't know what to ask. You don't know if you're doing it right. And no one is showing you. That was me six months ago. That's why I built this."*

# SLIDE 3: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

**Visual:** Personal story format - maybe a timeline or before/after

**Headline:** "My Breaking Point"

**Story (Short, Personal):**

**BEFORE:**
- Spending 3 hours/day writing sourcing emails
- Manually creating Boolean searches for every role
- Copy-pasting candidate info into spreadsheets
- Staying late to finish tasks

**THE QUESTION:**
*"What if AI could do this... but someone just showed me how?"*

**THE DECISION:**
*"If no one's going to teach us, I'll build something that does."*

**Speaker Notes:**
*"I was staying late every day. Writing the same emails over and over. Building Boolean searches from scratch. And I thought: AI is supposed to help with this. But no one is teaching me HOW. So I decided to build a platform that would. Not for executives. Not for people who already know AI. For US. The people on the floor doing the actual work."*

# SLIDE 4: WHAT I BUILT

**Speaker Notes:**
*"This is the platform. It's not fancy corporate training. It's practical. You can come here, search for 'sourcing email,' copy a prompt, paste it into ChatGPT, and boom - you just saved 20 minutes. That's what this is. Practical help from someone who does your job."*

# SLIDE 13: THE GRASSROOTS STORY

**Visual:** Journey/story format with photos or illustrations

**Headline:** "How a Sourcer Built This (And Why It Matters)"

**The Story:**

**THE PROBLEM:**
Dusan Grujin, a floor sourcer in GBS, was spending 15+ hours/week on tasks AI could automate - but no one was teaching him how.

**THE DECISION:**
"If no one's going to show us, I'll build something that does."

**THE BUILD:**
Nights and weekends. Trial and error. Testing prompts on real work. Getting feedback from other sourcers.

**THE SUPPORT:**
Nikolett Hajdu believed in the vision and supported the project under the AI Horizon initiative.

**THE RESULT:**
A platform built by people who do the work, for people who do the work. No corporate fluff. Just practical help.

**THE MOVEMENT:**
Now it's not just Dusan's project. It's ours. Every sourcer who uses it, improves it, and shares it makes it better.

**Bottom Line:**
**This is what happens when you give floor employees the tools to build solutions.**

**Speaker Notes:**
*"I want to be honest about this. I'm not a developer. I'm not an AI expert. I'm a sourcer who got frustrated and decided to do something about it. I built this on nights and weekends because I needed it to exist. Nikolett believed in what I was doing and helped make it part of AI Horizon. But this isn't a top-down initiative. This is bottom-up. Built by someone doing the work, for everyone doing the work."*
