## THE 30-SECOND OPENING

*"Hi, I'm Dusan. I'm a sourcer in GBS, just like many of you. Six months ago, I was frustrated - spending hours on tasks AI could do in minutes, but no one was showing me how. So I built this platform. Not as a corporate initiative. As a sourcer who needed it to exist. Today, I want to share it with you and show you how it can give you back 10-15 hours every week."*

## THE 3 CORE MESSAGES (Repeat Throughout)

### 1️⃣ **BUILT BY SOURCERS, FOR EVERYONE**
*"This was made by people who do the work, for people who do the work. Not theory. Practical help."*

### 2️⃣ **AI DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SCARY**
*"We made it simple. Copy a prompt. Paste it. Save time. That's it."*

### 3️⃣ **THIS IS US, HELPING US**
*"This is grassroots. Bottom-up. Built because we needed it, shared because everyone deserves it."*

## THE CLOSE (Last Words Before Q&A)

*"Six months ago, I was frustrated and overwhelmed. Today, I'm saving 15 hours a week. And I built this so you don't have to figure it out alone like I did. Scan this QR code. Take the 5-minute assessment. Try one prompt. See how it feels. Then let's build this together. Because this isn't about AI. This is about us taking control of our time, our skills, and our future. Thank you."*
