      "content": "GBS AI Initiative From a Spark to a Resource The story of how a dedicated team turned a shared vision into a practical tool for everyone in GBS. The Spark It all began here. Our journey started with a single spark—a presentation on Management Day that posed a simple, powerful question: How can we make Artificial Intelligence an accessible, practical partner for everyone in GBS? The Process Bringing the vision to life. Inspired, a group of us came together. The path forward was paved with countless calls and collaborative meetings. It was a challenging task, collecting information from across GBS to ensure our work was relevant and valuable. Call after call, meeting after meeting, what was once an abstract idea slowly began to take shape. The Breakthrough Sharing our progress. As the project gained form, we presented our initial findings at the Town Halls. The wave of curiosity and engagement we received was our breakthrough moment. It confirmed we were on the right path and fueled our determination to deliver something truly useful. The Result of Our Collaboration This prompt library is the result of what can be achieved when a group of people comes together with one goal: to bring AI closer to our colleagues and demystify how we can all work with it. But this is just the beginning of a long journey. The world of AI is constantly evolving, and so are we. This platform will grow with us—shaped by new ideas, new requests, and new voices from across our team. Welcome to the next step. Join Our AI Revolution This is more than a platform—it's a movement. Every prompt shared, every success story told, and every colleague trained brings us closer to our vision of AI-empowered excellence. Share Your Story Explore Prompts",

      "content": "What you may do Draft job descriptions, outreach, interview guides, and scorecards. Summarize evidence from a resume against a JD (no “fit score”). Identify gaps/ambiguities and propose questions to validate. Create structured evaluation criteria and rubrics for humans. What you may not do Use AI as an automated decision-maker (screen/shortlist/reject) without human review. Infer protected characteristics (age, ethnicity, health, pregnancy, religion, etc.). Store or share candidate PII in tools that are not approved for that data. Use “cultural fit” scoring; focus on job-related criteria only. No automated decisioning Treat AI outputs as suggestions. Final decisions must be made by trained recruiters/hiring managers with documented job-related evidence and consistent criteria. Candidate data rules (quick checklist) Minimize Use the minimum data needed to complete the task. Redact contact details and identifiers if possible. Control Use only approved tools for candidate content. Do not paste candidate data into public LLMs. Document Keep a clear rationale tied to the job requirements. Record what AI was used for (drafting, summarizing, etc.). Retain safely Do not store AI outputs containing PII outside approved systems. Follow retention rules (client + legal + company). Bias & adverse-impact guardrails Use consistent criteria for everyone; avoid “vibes” evaluation. Do not use proxies for protected characteristics (school prestige, gaps, location) as hard filters. Ask AI to propose verification questions , not conclusions. Prefer structured interviews and job-related work samples. Safe Prompt Pack (copy-ready) These prompts avoid automated decisioning and “fit scores”. They focus on evidence, gaps, and structured interviewing. 1) Evidence-based resume summary (no scoring) Copy Act as a recruiter. Task: Summarize the evidence in this resume against the job requirements, without giving a single “fit score” or ranking. Rules: - Use only job-related information in the resume; do not infer protected characteristics. - Separate “Evidence” from “Assumptions”. - If information is missing or unclear, list questions to validate. - Suggest structured interview questions mapped to each key requirement. Inputs: Job requirements: [PASTE JD REQUIREMENTS] Resume: [PASTE RESUME TEXT] Output format: - Requirements mapping table (Requirement | Evidence from resume | Missing/unclear | Validation question) - Risks/flags (job-related only) - Suggested interview questions (by competency) 2) Structured interview kit + scorecard (human-led) Copy Act as an interview designer for a structured hiring process. Create a structured interview kit for: [ROLE] Rules: - No automated decisioning: humans assess responses using the rubric you create. - Questions must be job-related and non-discriminatory. - Include “strong / acceptable / weak” indicators for each question. Inputs: Job requirements: [PASTE JD REQUIREMENTS] Output format: 1) Interview plan (stages + who interviews + purpose) 2) Question bank (Competency | Question | What good looks like | Red flags) 3) Scorecard rubric (Competency | Rating anchors | Notes) 3) Outreach message (privacy-safe) Copy Write a concise, professional outreach message for [ROLE]. Rules: - Do not include sensitive personal data. - Focus on role value proposition and clear next step. - Offer an opt-out. Inputs: Company/context: [CONTEXT] Candidate public profile highlights: [BULLETS] Output format: Subject line options (3) Message (120–180 words) Follow-up (1 short message)",

This training provides the framework and action plan to strategically integrate Gemini Pro into your team's daily workflows, unlocking new levels of productivity and value. With Gemini, you can instantly: 1. The Mindset View Gemini Pro not as a job replacement, but as a powerful partner that handles tedious work, freeing your team for higher-value strategic thinking. 2. The Framework Learn a simple but effective method to identify the best opportunities for AI within your team's existing processes and workflows. 3. The Action Plan Leave with a concrete first step to immediately begin implementing Gemini Pro, driving quick wins and building momentum for change. Start Learning: See The Framework Unlock Real Results Integrating AI isn't just about new technology; it's about tangible outcomes. Here are the results you can aim for. 40% Less Time on Reports Automate first drafts of weekly and monthly reports, freeing up your team for analysis. 5x Faster Insights Summarize long documents, emails, and meeting transcripts in seconds, not hours. 1 Hr Saved Per Day By automating email drafts, meeting agendas, and follow-ups, you reclaim valuable time. The GBS Opportunity Framework This section introduces our core framework: Don't just use AI, build your workflows around it. We'll start by identifying where your team's time is spent and then connect those tasks directly to AI-powered solutions. My Team's \"4 R's\" Audit Adjust the sliders to estimate your team's time distribution. The chart will update instantly. Repetitive 35% Research-heavy 25% Reactive 20% Reporting 20% Total: 100% Discover Your AI Opportunities Use the sliders on the left to create a personalized model of your team's workload. Once the chart reflects your reality, click on its segments to reveal specific ways Gemini can streamline work, saving time and reducing manual effort. Example Gemini Applications: Best Practices for Prompting Follow these golden rules to get the best possible results from Gemini. A well-crafted prompt is the key to unlocking high-quality, relevant, and actionable outputs. 1. Give Clear Context Tell Gemini what you're doing and set the scene clearly. The more background it has, the more relevant the response will be. \"I have a biology test in 2 days.\" 2. Be Specific About Output Say exactly what you want back. Include the desired type, format, length, or structure. \"Give 10 MCQs on the circulatory system.\" 3. Assign the AI a Role Define who Gemini should act as. This adds a specific tone, style, and level of expertise to the response. \"Act as a finance professor.\" 4. Break It Into Steps For complex requests, break your needs into logical steps. This helps the AI follow your train of thought. \"Explain in 3 steps using an analogy.\" 5. Provide Examples If you want a specific style or structure, give Gemini an example of what you're looking for. \"Give 3 ways photosynthesis helps humans.\" 6. Refine and Retry Your first try is a draft. If the output isn't quite right, tweak your prompt with more clarity and try again. Better input → better output. 7. Avoid Vague Language Don't be general. Vague inputs lead to weak replies. Replace \"help me study\" with a specific request. Skip \"Help me study.\" 8. Treat It Like an Assistant Write like you're briefing a new team member. Be simple, clear, and direct in your instructions. Like giving a task to an intern. 9. Choose a Format Explicitly tell the AI how to present the information, whether as bullets, a numbered list, a table, or prose. \"Summarize as a table.\" 10. Provide Negative Constraints Sometimes it's helpful to tell the AI what *not* to do. This helps narrow its focus and avoid unwanted information. \"Write an email to the team, but do not use overly corporate jargon.\" Pro-Level Prompting Examples Garbage in, garbage out. If your prompts suck, your results will too. Here's how pros prompt Gemini. 11. Be Specific and Detailed Transform vague requests into detailed, actionable prompts. Provide context, specify your role, set clear expectations, and include concrete deliverables. ❌ Don't say: \"Help me source candidates\" ✅ Say: \"You're a senior RPO sourcing specialist at Randstad. I need 15 qualified candidates for (ROLE) at (CLIENT COMPANY) within 72 hours. Create a multi-channel sourcing strategy including: Boolean search strings for LinkedIn/Indeed, 5 alternative sourcing channels, and a candidate outreach sequence that gets 40%+ response rates. Show me the exact messaging for each touchpoint.\" 12. Provide Context and Expertise Give the AI a specific role and detailed context. Include your goals, constraints, and expected deliverables to get professional-level output. ❌ Don't say: \"Schedule interviews better\" ✅ Say: \"I'm coordinating interviews for 12 candidates across 3 time zones with 5 hiring managers who have conflicting",

The Thinking Transformation Journey 😵 🤔 🎯 Vague Thinking \"Make this better\" or \"Help me with this task\" Learning Phase Starting to add context and constraints Specific Thinking Crystal clear instructions with all details The Fundamental Shift: Specificity as a Superpower Prompt engineering forces us to eliminate ambiguity. Every word counts. Every detail matters. This precision becomes a mental habit that transforms how we communicate, delegate, and solve problems. ❌ Old Way of Thinking Request: \"Write me an email\" Delegation: \"Make this report better\" Problem: \"This isn't working\" Result: Confusion, back-and-forth, wasted time VS ✅ Prompt-Trained Thinking Request: \"Write a professional follow-up email to [candidate name] for [role], mentioning [specific interview points], with a warm but formal tone, 150 words max\" Delegation: \"Restructure this report to highlight ROI metrics first, add visual charts for sections 2-4, and include 3 actionable recommendations\" Problem: \"The Boolean search returns 500+ results but only 5% match our requirements. Need to refine for [specific criteria]\" Result: Clear execution, first-time success, efficiency Deep Dive: How Specificity Transforms Different Areas 💼 At Work: From Vague to Precise See how prompt engineering transforms workplace communication Before: Vague Delegation \"Can you improve our candidate outreach? The response rates aren't great.\" Result: Team member spends hours guessing what \"improve\" means, tries random changes, no clear success metrics. After: Prompt-Trained Delegation \"Analyze our last 50 candidate outreach emails. Identify the 3 highest-performing subject lines and message structures. Create 5 new templates using these patterns, targeting software engineers with 3-5 years experience. Include personalization fields for [company], [role], and [specific skill]. Test with A/B split over 2 weeks, measuring open rates and response rates.\" Result: Clear action plan, measurable outcomes, specific deliverables, timeline defined. 🧠 Problem-Solving: Breaking Down Complexity How specific thinking transforms problem-solving approaches The Prompt Engineering Problem-Solving Framework: 🎯 Define Precisely What exactly is the problem? Include constraints, context, and desired outcome. 📊 Specify Context What information is relevant? What are the limitations and requirements? ⚡ Request Format How should the solution be structured? What format works best? ✅ Success Criteria How will you know it worked? What metrics matter? 🏠 Personal Life: Intentional Decision-Making How prompt thinking improves personal decisions and self-reflection Self-Reflection Prompts You'll Start Using: Instead of: \"I should be healthier\" Prompt-trained: \"List 3 specific, measurable health changes I can implement this week, considering my current schedule constraints and energy levels. Include success metrics and potential obstacles.\" Instead of: \"I need to decide about this job offer\" Prompt-trained: \"Analyze this job decision using these criteria: salary impact (30%), career growth (25%), work-life balance (25%), company culture (20%). Rate each option 1-10, provide reasoning, and recommend next steps.\" The Real Superpower: Clarity of Thought Prompt engineering is training your brain to eliminate ambiguity and think with laser precision. It's not just about AI—it's about becoming someone who asks better questions, gives clearer instructions, and solves problems more effectively. Every time you write a specific prompt, you're practicing the skill of clear thinking. And that skill transforms everything.",

Users can define each Gem's behavior by providing explicit instructions, preferred tone, context, and desired outputs. In the mini-course, you explored how assigning roles in prompts can guide the AI's behavior more effectively. With Gemini, you don't need to repeat these role assignments every time—especially for tasks that require consistent expertise—since you can set them up once within a custom Gem. Important: Gems are not AI agents; they are customized versions of an AI model tailored to follow specific instructions, tone, and behavior. They don't take autonomous actions or browse the web on their own, but respond based on the context and prompts you provide. 3 Pre-made Gems ∞ Custom Possibilities 1x Setup Required 24/7 Availability The Pre-made Gems 💼 1. Career Guide This Gem is designed to help users navigate their professional development. It offers tailored suggestions for career exploration, job searching, interview preparation, and skill enhancement. This Gem can analyze your interests and resume to provide personalized advice and even conduct mock interviews. 📋 View Complete Instructions Copy Purpose You are a supportive and knowledgeable career coach dedicated to helping me enhance my professional skills and achieve my career goals. You are an expert on navigating a professional career, and you'll be my teacher and my guide on achieving professional success. Goals Understand my request: Based on my input, you'll identify my specific professional development goal or goals (e.g. improve my presentation skills, master new software, enhance my leadership abilities). Develop a strategic plan: You'll break down my goal or goals into 3–4 actionable subtopics, creating a clear, step-by-step learning plan tailored to my needs. Confirm and customise: You'll present the plan to me in a concise format, allowing me to revise or approve it. If I have any objections or changes to the plan, make sure you adapt it to the circumstances or the changes I request in my input. We'll work together to ensure it aligns perfectly with my goals, so always ask if I want to make changes and incorporate them in your subsequent responses. Overall direction You'll help me in various ways, inferring the type of coaching that's needed based on my inputs. Always adapt the content you provide based on my needs, interests and goals. Regardless of my goals, always present the content in a brief, simple and logical way so that you don't overwhelm me with too much content at once. Make sure to ask clarifying and follow-up questions. Never overwhelm me with multiple questions at once. Provide hints if I get stuck, encouraging me to find the answers myself. Always be encouraging. Maintain a professional and supportive tone throughout our interactions. Keep context across the entire conversation, ensuring that your ideas and responses are related to all the previous turns of conversation. If greeted or asked what you can do, please briefly explain your purpose. Keep it concise and to the point, giving some short examples. Step-by-step instructions Guided learning journey: First, analyse my input to extract my main development goal or goals, in order to tackle each of them in a focused manner. Share with me the conclusions you made about my needs in a development plan with a brief explanation on actionable subtopics based on my development goal or goals. Ask me if I want to proceed with the plan or if I want to revise or change it. If I want to revise or make changes, update the development plan accordingly, showing me the revised plan, and follow the development plan throughout the conversation. After you complete the steps above, begin explaining the first subtopic, providing brief and clear explanations, using relevant workplace examples and analogies for better understanding. Follow that by engaging me in discussions about realistic work scenarios to apply the concepts, like: - Mock presentations or negotiations - Role-playing challenging workplace conversations - Case study analysis related to the skill - Brainstorming sessions for problem-solving - Vocabulary exercises focused on industry terminology Throughout the entire conversation, you'll ask insightful questions, allowing me to demonstrate my understanding and identify areas for improvement. You'll continuously provide constructive feedback on my performance in each scenario, highlighting strengths and areas for growth. After discussing each subtopic, you'll ask if I have any questions, ensuring that I grasp the material thoroughly before moving on. Recap and assessment: Once we've covered all subtopics, you'll offer a recap of key takeaways or a short quiz to assess my progress. If I choose a quiz, you'll provide multiple-choice questions related to my professional goal, along with feedback on my answers. You'll",

Explain a savings strategy for someone starting a business.\" 3 Break Down Complex Tasks Use sequential, interactive prompts for clarity when dealing with complex topics. ✅ Example: \"Explain machine learning basics. Follow up with examples of its real-world applications.\" 4 Use Affirmative Directives Phrase instructions positively using \"Do\" rather than \"Don't.\" ✅ Good: \"Provide an engaging introduction to AI ethics.\" ❌ Avoid: \"Don't make it overly technical.\" 5 Utilize Instruction Tokens for Structure Organize prompts with clear indicators for clarity and advanced outputs. ✅ Example: Role: You are a historian explaining ancient Greek philosophy. Task: Summarize the key ideas of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in under 500 words. 6 Include Few-Shot Examples Provide examples of the desired format or tone to guide Gemini's response. ✅ Example: \"Write an email proposal. Example: 'Dear [Name], I am reaching out regarding...' Now, write a similar email for a marketing proposal.\" 7 Control Length Explicitly Specify the desired response length to get appropriately sized outputs. ✅ Examples: • \"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points.\" • \"Write a 300-word description of Gemini's capabilities.\" 8 Use Instructional Keywords Include phrases like 'Your task is' or 'You MUST' to emphasize requirements. ✅ Example: \"Your task is to analyze this data and explain its key insights.\" 9 Encourage Iterative Clarification Allow Gemini to ask clarifying questions if the task is ambiguous. ✅ Example: \"From now on, ask questions to gather all details before generating outputs.\" 10 Leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Ask Gemini to think step by step for logical, well-reasoned outputs. ✅ Example: \"Explain how photosynthesis works, step by step.\" Structure & Format (11-20) Organizing prompts for maximum clarity and effectiveness 11 Use Indicators to Focus Context Separate instructions, examples, and input with clear indicators. ✅ Example: Task: Analyze this text for its historical accuracy. Text: The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. 12 Combine Techniques Pair Chain-of-Thought with Few-Shot examples for complex tasks. ✅ Example: \"Think step by step to solve this logic puzzle. Here's an example of how to approach it...\" 13 Ask for Unbiased Responses Ensure outputs are free of stereotypes or bias by explicitly requesting neutrality. ✅ Example: \"Ensure your explanation is unbiased and factual.\" 14 Optimize Token Usage Keep prompts concise while providing enough context for accurate responses. ✅ Example: \"Summarize this 1,000-word document in 5 sentences.\" 15 Add Output Primers End prompts with the start of the desired output to guide the response format. ✅ Example: \"A successful marketing strategy includes...\" 16 Pretend Like You're Tipping Your AI Add motivational language to encourage better performance (experimental technique). ✅ Example: \"I'm going to tip $20 for a better solution!\" 17 Specify Style and Format Define tone, structure, or style requirements explicitly. ✅ Examples: • \"Write a humorous blog post about technology.\" • \"Format your response as a Q&A dialogue.\" 18 Combine Chain-of-Thought with Few-Shot Examples Guide reasoning with a logical step-by-step approach, using examples for context. ✅ Example: \"Think step by step: Explain the causes of inflation. Example: 'Rising demand can outpace supply...' Now explain other causes.\" 19 Use Follow-Up Questions for Refinement Refine initial outputs with targeted follow-up questions. ✅ Example: \"Great summary. Can you simplify this explanation for a high school audience?\" 20 Leverage Multi-Modal Inputs Add images, documents, or other media to improve your prompt when necessary. ✅ Example: \"Write an imaginary background story for this cat shown in photo. Come up with a reason why it might be hiding there and why its expression is that way.\" Advanced Techniques (21-30) Professional-level strategies for complex prompt engineering 21 Create Iterative Sequences Use a sequence of prompts to guide detailed, comprehensive outputs. ✅ Example: Step 1: List key AI advancements. Step 2: Explain their impact on healthcare. Step 3: Suggest ethical considerations. 22 Use Output Primers Prime Gemini by including the beginning of the desired response. ✅ Example: \"A good business plan includes three elements: 1) Market analysis...\" 23 Experiment and Refine Test and improve your prompts iteratively based on Gemini's outputs. ✅ Example: \"Adjust this summary to include more",

      "content": "Introduction Output Types Context Mastery Enhancement Formatting Advanced 🎯 What You'll Learn • Why context matters: Understanding how Gemini uses background information • Types of context: Situational, domain-specific, and example-based context • Context layering: Building comprehensive background information • Context optimization: Providing just enough without overwhelming • Practical application: Real-world scenarios and hands-on practice 🎭 Situational Context 🏢 Domain Context 📝 Example Context 👥 Audience Context ⚖️ Constraint Context 🎭 Situational Context Situational context provides the \"when,\" \"where,\" and \"why\" behind your request. It helps Gemini understand the circumstances and adapt its response accordingly. ❌ Without Situational Context \"Write an email about the meeting.\" Too vague - Gemini doesn't know what kind of meeting, the purpose, or the tone needed. ✅ With Situational Context \"Write a follow-up email to team members after our quarterly planning meeting yesterday. The meeting ran over time, and we need to reschedule the budget discussion. Keep the tone professional but understanding.\" Clear situation, specific circumstances, and appropriate tone guidance. Key Elements: Time frame, location, circumstances, urgency level, emotional context, and any relevant background events. 🏢 Domain Context Domain context establishes the field, industry, or area of expertise relevant to your request. This helps Gemini use appropriate terminology and knowledge. ❌ Without Domain Context \"Explain the process of optimization.\" Unclear domain - could be business, software, mathematics, or many other fields. ✅ With Domain Context \"As a software engineer working on web applications, explain the process of database query optimization for improving page load times in e-commerce sites.\" Specific domain (software engineering), context (web apps), and application (e-commerce). Domain Types: Industry (healthcare, finance), Role (developer, manager), Field (marketing, engineering), or Specialty (machine learning, UX design). 📝 Example Context Example context provides concrete instances or patterns that demonstrate what you're looking for. This is especially powerful for establishing style, format, or approach. ❌ Without Example Context \"Write a product description that's engaging.\" \"Engaging\" is subjective - no clear style or format guidance. ✅ With Example Context \"Write a product description similar to Apple's style - clean, benefit-focused, and emotionally resonant. For example, instead of 'fast processor,' they say 'lightning-fast performance that keeps up with your creativity.' Apply this approach to our new wireless headphones.\" Clear style reference with specific example showing the desired approach. Example Types: Style samples, format templates, similar successful cases, or specific instances that demonstrate your desired outcome. 👥 Audience Context Audience context defines who will receive or consume the output. This dramatically affects tone, complexity, terminology, and approach. ❌ Without Audience Context \"Explain machine learning.\" No audience specified - could be for experts, beginners, children, or executives. ✅ With Audience Context \"Explain machine learning to a group of non-technical executives who need to understand its business value and implementation costs. Focus on ROI, risks, and practical applications rather than technical details.\" Clear audience (executives), knowledge level (non-technical), and focus areas (business value). Audience Factors: Technical expertise, role/position, age group, cultural background, time constraints, and decision-making authority. ⚖️ Constraint Context Constraint context establishes limitations, requirements, or boundaries that must be respected. This includes length limits, style requirements, or content restrictions. ❌ Without Constraint Context \"Write a social media post about our new product.\" No platform, length, or style constraints specified. ✅ With Constraint Context \"Write a LinkedIn post about our new product launch. Keep it under 150 words, maintain a professional tone, include a call-to-action, and avoid overly promotional language. The post should comply with our brand guidelines: no exclamation marks, focus on value rather than features.\" Clear platform, length limit, tone requirements, and brand constraints. Constraint Types: Length limits, format requirements, tone restrictions, brand guidelines, legal considerations, and platform-specific rules. 🛠️ Interactive Context Builder Practice building comprehensive context for better Gemini responses Scenario: Product Launch Announcement You need to create content announcing a new software product.

      "content": "🚀 Gemini's Core Advantage Gemini's core strength lies in its deep integration with Google Workspace tools like Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. This means Gemini can directly understand and interact with your existing work environment. Unlike other large language models that primarily function as standalone chatbots, Gemini's ability to seamlessly assist within your Google apps provides a unique advantage, making your daily tasks more efficient and contextually intelligent. Seamless Workspace Integration 📧 → 📄 → 🤖 → 📊 → 🎥 Gmail • Docs • Gemini AI • Sheets • Meet Access Requirements 🏢 Google Workspace Editions Business, Enterprise, Education 👤 Google One AI Premium For personal accounts 🔧 Add-on Required Gemini features subscription 📋 To unlock Gemini's capabilities within Google Workspace: • Google Workspace Editions: Gemini is available as an add-on for most existing Google Workspace editions (Business, Enterprise, Education, etc.) • Google One AI Premium: For individual users, access often comes with a Google One AI Premium subscription • Interface Access: Once enabled, Gemini appears as an \"Ask Gemini\" button, dedicated sidebar, or blue pen icon within apps 📄 Gemini in Google Docs Gemini in Google Docs acts as your writing assistant, helping you draft, refine, and generate new content directly within your documents. It can kickstart new projects by creating initial drafts, rephrasing existing text to adjust tone or clarity, and even summarizing long documents for quick understanding. ✍️ Writing and Refining Content Draft new content, rewrite existing text to make it more formal or casual, shorten or elaborate on sections, and rephrase sentences. 📋 Summarizing Summarize your documents, either the entire file or specific sections you highlight. Also summarize emails from Gmail and files from Drive. 🎨 Generating Images Ask Gemini to create images based on your prompts, which can be inserted directly into your document. 💡 Getting Creative Ideas Provide suggestions and ideas to help you overcome writer's block or explore different angles for your content. 🔗 Referencing External Information Reference your Google Drive files and Gmail emails to get responses generated by Gemini based on that information. 💎 Using Gems For repetitive tasks, you can chat with or create your own \"Gems,\" which are custom assistants within Gemini. 💬 Example Prompts: \"Draft a project proposal for a new employee onboarding program at a mid-sized tech company that currently lacks a formal process.\" [highlight text] \"Rewrite this paragraph to be more formal.\" \"Summarize this document in three bullet points.\" 📧 Gemini in Gmail Gemini in Gmail acts as an intelligent assistant, streamlining your email management. It can quickly summarize lengthy email threads, draft new messages or suggest replies tailored to the conversation's context, and even help you find specific information within your inbox or linked Google Drive files. 📝 Summarize Email Threads Provide summaries of long email threads, helping you quickly understand the key points of a conversation. 💬 Suggest Responses Suggest replies to email threads or help you draft new emails based on context. ✉️ Draft Emails Turn notes or a few sentences into a ready-to-send message based on your prompts. 🔍 Find Information Search your inbox and Google Drive files to find specific information from previous emails or documents. 📅 Calendar Integration Get details about events on your primary calendar and create new events. 🗂️ Organize Inbox Help with tasks like deleting or archiving emails, and assist with scheduling appointments. 💬 Example Prompts: \"Summarize this email thread.\" \"Draft a polite reply declining this invitation.\" \"Find all emails from John about the Q3 report.\" 🎥 Gemini in Google Meet Gemini in Google Meet transforms your meetings by handling essential tasks so you can focus on the discussion. It can automatically take detailed notes, generate summaries of key decisions and action items, and even provide real-time translated captions to ensure everyone is on the same page. 📝 Automatic Note-Taking Automatically capture meeting notes, including key discussion points and action items, and generate post-meeting summaries. 🌍 Translated Captions Provides real-time translated captions for over 60 languages, breaking down language barriers in international meetings. 🎬 Enhanced Audio & Video Features like Studio Sound and Studio Lighting use AI to improve audio clarity and video quality. 🖼️ Custom Backgrounds Use Gemini to generate unique, AI-powered virtual backgrounds for your video calls. 🔊 Adaptive Audio Synchronize microphones and speakers from multiple laptops in the same room to prevent echoes and feedback. 💬 Example Prompts: \"Summarize the meeting so far.\" \"What were the key decisions made?\" \"List the action items and who is responsible for each.\" Gemini's @ Function Gemini's @ function in Google Workspace lets you reference content from apps like Drive or Gmail directly in your prompts.",

Goal ⚙️ AI drafts Search ideas, outreach drafts, summaries, templates 🧠 Humans decide Must-haves, trade-offs, priorities, final messages 🧭 Guardrails No automated decisioning; validate facts; protect data If you haven’t already, read the safe-use rules in AI Hiring Governance . The Simple Rule If it's repetitive, and you've done it 5+ times this month — let AI draft it first. ✅ Good uses Drafting, summarizing, brainstorming options, structuring notes 🚫 Not the use Auto-rejecting, “fit scores”, guessing sensitive traits What AI Assist Builds On Your best AI outputs come from the 20% foundation: a clean Role DNA , a quick title map , and a starter skeleton search string. Review 20% Search Craft Daily AI Checklist What “30% AI” Looks Like in Everyday Work Concrete moments to use AI (draft first, validate second) 📝 Before You Start Search Turn a messy JD + notes into a clean Role DNA . Ask AI for titles, synonyms, and “profiles to avoid” (then validate). 🔎 While You Search Ask AI for: alternative job titles + seniority variations missing keywords/synonyms 3 ways to widen vs 3 ways to narrow your search Let it draft the first version; you clean it up and run it. 💬 Before You Write Outreach Paste a profile + role summary and ask for: 3 outreach variants (short / casual / direct) 1 follow-up for no response after 5–7 days You add one real detail + your human tone. 📞 After Calls / Intakes Paste notes; ask AI to: summarize into a clean email to HM extract must-haves vs flex zones draft structured screening questions (humans decide) 🧩 When You're Stuck “What am I missing in my search and why?” “Which adjacent profiles might convert?” “How could I reframe this role to be more attractive (truthfully)?” And Always AI drafts — you decide. AI suggests — you own the final version. Core Prompts (Copy-Ready) GUIDE Use Role DNA as the input When your prompt starts with Role DNA, outputs get sharper and safer. “Use this Role DNA to generate: (1) 10–15 target titles, (2) 8–12 keyword/synonym ideas, (3) a simple LinkedIn Boolean skeleton, and (4) 3 widen vs 3 narrow suggestions. Do not invent details not supported by the Role DNA.” Expand Your Universe Ask for options, then validate with real profiles. 10 adjacent titles to X (with seniority notes) 10 companies where this profile likely exists 10 “tool vs outcome” synonyms (what people write in profiles) Prioritize Outreach (job-related only) Better than “fit scores”: ask for evidence + gaps. “Here are 10–15 profile snippets. For each, map evidence to the Role DNA (Evidence / Missing / Validation question). Then suggest an outreach priority order (High/Medium/Low) with one reason. No automated decisioning, no protected traits.” Sanity-Checking Never trust AI blindly. Quick checks: “Is this realistic for this country/seniority?” “Which assumptions are you making — and what would verify them?” “Are we over-indexing on one background/company?” TRAINING Training Blocks Hands-on practice aligned with 20% Search Craft A1 AI for Search & First Shortlist (60 min) Objective: Get faster to a decent first search and a first outreach priority list (not “perfect”). Steps: Pick one live role for everyone. Each sourcer generates a Role DNA (or uses the agreed version) and asks AI for: 2–3 Boolean/X-ray variants title/synonym expansion 3 widen vs 3 narrow suggestions Run the searches; collect 10 profiles . Ask AI to map each profile to Role DNA (Evidence / Missing / Validation question). Group debrief: what helped, what was noise, what changed your search. Outcome: Reusable Role DNA prompt + title prompt 3–5 “starter skeletons” saved for the team library One evidence-mapping prompt for consistent prioritization A2 Outreach Co-Pilot (60 min) Objective: AI drafts the first version; you make it human, specific, and short. Steps: Each sourcer picks one real role and one real profile . Ask AI for 3 variants (short / casual / direct) + a follow-up for 5–7 days . Humanize: Trim to 120–180 words Add one true detail from the profile End with one simple question Pair feedback: would you reply? what feels fake? what’s unclear? Outcome: A small Outreach Prompt Pack everyone can reuse Team standard: AI first draft, human final voice A3 HM Debrief Assistant (45 min) Objective: Go from messy notes to a clean, reusable intake structure. Steps: Use real intake call notes (messy is fine). Paste into AI with a prompt like: “Turn this into a structured intake summary: context, must-haves, nice-to-haves, flex zones, target companies, profiles to avoid, 5 screening questions, and 3 risks to watch. Don’t invent details; flag anything unclear.” Compare to what the HM actually meant; adjust wording. Save the final template + 2–3 strong examples. Outcome: Every new role starts with a clean intake summary Less back-and-forth, clearer search direction Let AI Do the Heavy Lifting",

      "content": "🧩 How to Use AI in Your Day The Minimum Expected from Everyone A simple, actionable checklist for sourcers & recruiters. Drop this into your workflow and make AI work for you. This is not optional . This is the baseline. If you're not doing at least half of these daily, you're working too hard. 1 Before You Start Search Set Up the Role Turn JD + notes into a clear brief Paste JD + your notes into AI. Ask: \"Turn this into a 1-page search brief: context, must-haves, nice-to-haves, target companies, titles to target, profiles to avoid.\" Ask for title & keyword ideas \"Give me 10 job titles and 10 keywords I should search for this role in [country/region].\" Rule: If you're starting from a blank page you've already skipped a step. 2 While You Search Let AI Build the Skeleton Get AI to write your first Boolean / X-ray \"Create 3 LinkedIn Boolean strings for this role. Keep each on one line. Focus on [seniority] in [location].\" Ask for adjacent ideas \"What adjacent roles or industries might have people who fit this role but don't have the exact title?\" Sanity-check your search \"Here is my current search logic. What might be missing or too narrow for this role?\" Remember: You still own the final version, but AI makes version 1 and 2 for you. 3 Before You Write Outreach Stop Starting from Zero Use AI for 1st draft of outreach Paste role summary + candidate profile. \"Write 2 short outreach messages (max 5 sentences) to this candidate about this role. Tone: human, direct, no corporate fluff. End with a simple question.\" Use AI for follow-up \"Write 1 follow-up message if the candidate hasn't replied in 7 days. Keep it light, respectful, and under 4 sentences.\" Your rule: AI drafts you shorten, add 1 real detail from the profile, and make it sound like you . 4 After Calls Don't Manually Fight with Notes Summarize candidate calls \"Summarize this candidate call in bullet points: motivation, key skills, risks/concerns, salary expectations, location/relocation, notice period. Max 12 bullets.\" Turn this into HM-ready feedback \"Turn this into a short email update for the hiring manager: 35 bullets, clear recommendation (move forward / reject / hold) and 23 questions for HM if needed.\" Build quick scorecards \"Based on this role brief, create a simple 5-criteria scorecard (15 scale) I can use to rate candidates after screening.\" 5 After Intake / HM Calls Make Structure, Not Chaos Clean up intake Paste messy HM notes. \"Turn this into a structured intake summary: context, must-haves, nice-to-haves, target companies, profiles to avoid, 5 screening questions, 3 risk areas to watch.\" Ask AI what's unclear \"From this summary, list what is still unclear or risky and should be confirmed with the HM.\" Result: Next time you talk to HM, you have specific questions, not \"do you have any updates?\" 6 When You Have Profiles Let AI Help You Prioritize Use AI for shortlisting Paste 815 profile snippets. \"From these profiles, rank the top 10 to contact first for this role. For each, give 12 lines: why they're a fit and what to double-check on the call.\" Remember: You still decide, but you save brain energy on first pass. 7 When You're Stuck Get AI to Challenge Your Thinking Use AI as a thinking partner Ask questions like: \"What might I be missing in my search strategy for this role?\" \"What are 5 different angles I could use in outreach to this type of candidate?\" \"How could I reframe this role to make it more attractive without lying?\" 8 Guardrails How NOT to Use AI Never copy-paste without reading If you can't stand behind the message or summary don't send it. No inventing facts Always tell AI: \"If information is missing, don't make it up. Just say it's missing.\" Protect candidate trust Don't paste sensitive info with names if not needed. Remove anything you wouldn't want in writing somewhere else. This Is The Baseline If you're doing at least 4 of these 8 things daily, you're ahead of 80% of recruiters.

      "content": "🤝 50% Human & Brand Where We Actually Win Candidates and hiring managers remember how you communicate, not which Boolean you used. GOAL The Objective Build trust with candidates and hiring managers by writing and speaking like a human. AI can draft the first version, but you own the voice and the relationship. 🧩 From 20% Role DNA = what to personalize around 🤖 From 30% AI drafts options fast (you validate) 🤝 This 50% Tone, clarity, trust, influence, follow-through Keep it safe: follow AI Hiring Governance (no automated decisioning, protect candidate data, avoid bias). Simple “Write-As-You-Speak” Frameworks Three simple rules you can use under pressure 1 Bar Test Rule: “Would I say this out loud in a coffee chat?” If not, it’s probably jargon. ✗ Corporate speak “I’d love to present you with an exciting opportunity within a leading organization.” ✓ Human speak “Saw your profile and thought you’re strong in X. Can I run a role past you?” Tiny reminder: “Bar test: yes/no?” 2 3-Line Outreach SAY IT, THEN WRITE IT. Every cold message is 3 chunks (max): 1) Why you One true detail from their profile 2) Why this Role context + value (from Role DNA) 3) Next step One clear question (yes/no works) Example Why you: “Noticed you’ve done ADC/bioconjugation work in Germany.” Why this: “We’re building X on a small team and you’d own Y.” Next step: “Open to a 10-minute chat this week?” AI can help, but don’t outsource the human part Use AI to draft 3 versions, then run the Bar Test, remove fluff, and add one true detail you actually saw. 3 Jargon Swap (tiny word choices) If you use these words, candidates tune out: Instead of… Say… “opportunity” “role” “organization” “company” / “team” “utilize” “use” “proceed with your application” “move forward” / “next step” “reach out” “message” / “write” Rule: If you wouldn’t say it out loud, pick the simpler word. BS FILTER Obvious Adams (the final quality check) Say the simple, honest, obvious thing AI gives you options. These frameworks give you structure. Obvious Adams makes sure you’re still saying something real. OPEN Open the full Obvious Adams framework The 5-Question Check Before you hit send, ask: 1) Obvious Problem What situation/pain is this person in right now? 2) Obvious Truth What honest thing proves you get it? 3) Obvious Fix What simple option are you offering? 4) Obvious Proof What concrete detail makes this believable? 5) Obvious Next Step What’s the smallest, clearest action you’re asking for? Rule of thumb If you can’t answer at least 3 out of 5 , you’re probably writing fluff. TRAINING Training Blocks Hands-on practice that ties 20% clarity + 30% drafting into 50% trust H1 Personalization in 2 Minutes (45 min) Objective: Use Role DNA + one true profile detail to write messages that feel real. Pick one live role and agree the Role DNA (from 20%). Pick one candidate profile and extract 1 true detail (project, tool, outcome). Draft a 3-line message (AI can draft variants; you choose and edit). Peer review with Bar Test + Obvious Adams (at least 3/5 answers). Outcome: A small “human outreach” library you can reuse by function. H2 Voice & Tone Library (45 min) Objective: Create a consistent “human voice” for your team (so AI drafts don’t sound generic). Collect 5 examples of messages you’d actually reply to (from the team). Extract: preferred length, tone, sign-off style, and “banned phrases”. Write a one-page “voice guide” (what we do / what we avoid). Outcome: Cleaner, more consistent outreach across the team. H3 Trust-Building Calls (60 min) Objective: Run calls that feel human: clear, honest, and candidate-centered. Practice a 3-part call: context → role truth → next steps. Use “Obvious Proof” details (not hype): team size, manager style, scope, trade-offs. Close with one clear next step and timeframe. Outcome: Higher trust, fewer drop-offs, less ghosting. H4 HM Influence & Difficult Conversations (60 min) Use real examples: “not a culture fit”, “just send more CVs”, slow feedback. Micro framework Write the corporate version first (how people usually write it). Run Bar Test + 3-Line Structure (acknowledge → reality/risk → next step). Run Obvious Adams (at least 3/5). Outcome: A “plain language responses” playbook for tricky HM situations. This Is Where You Win Master these frameworks and you’ll build trust, get responses, and create a brand people remember.

Use them every time. 🧭 3-Minute Pre-Search Checklist Before you open LinkedIn / CVDB / AI Use this to start every search right 1 Role DNA Sanity Check 6090 seconds Ask yourself: 1 Do I have 34 clear must-haves written down? Skills / technologies / domain (e.g. ADC, GMP, B2B, etc.) 2 Did I write 12 lines of context? Industry, team type, lab vs office, level (junior/medior/senior) 3 Do I know the flex zones? What can we bend on? years of experience, industry, exact title? ⚠ If it's all still in your head → write a 57 bullet search brief first. 2 Titles & Synonyms 60 seconds 4 Have I listed at least: 23 obvious titles? 23 alternative/hidden titles? (e.g. Scientist / Research Associate / Engineer) 5 Did I think about company types where this person may sit? Big pharma / CRO / biotech / vendor / consultancy? 💡 Optional AI Assist: \"Here's my role brief. Suggest 5 alternative job titles and 10 keywords I should include in my search.\" 3 Search Shape 60 seconds 6 What will be my first search angle? Title + key skill? Company-based? Skill-based? 7 Is my location logic realistic? Commutable area? Hybrid? Remote? Any relocation? 8 Have I picked one starter template from our team skeletons? Lab / commercial / tech starter then adapt 4 Ready to Search? 30 seconds Quick self-check: 9 Can I explain this role in one sentence to a candidate? 10 If I had to brief AI in 23 lines , would it be clear? If YES → you're ready. 🚀 If NO → your problem is not Boolean, it's the brief. Fix that first. 🧭 3-Minute Stuck-Search Checklist When you're 1015 minutes in and thinking \"there are no candidates\" Use this whenever: › You get 020 results in a normal market, or › You get tons of junk, or › All profiles feel \"almost but not quite right\" 1 Check the Brief, Not the String 60 seconds 1 Did I over-translate HM fantasy into must-haves? Can one person realistically have all the things we listed? 2 Is something that should be a flex zone sitting as a hard filter? Exact industry? Exact tech stack? Exact company type? If yes → relax 12 things and see what changes. 2 Widen Titles & Keywords 60 seconds 3 Do I only have 12 titles in my string? Add 23 more realistic variations (Senior / Lead / Associate etc.) 4 Am I using too specific jargon that only exists at one company? Replace with more generic skills / methods / tools 5 Ask AI quickly: \"Here is my current search and role brief. Suggest 5 more job titles and 10 related keywords I might be missing.\" Update and rerun. 3 Check Geography & Filters 60 seconds 6 Is my location filter killing the search? Try: city + region + \"within X km\" / neighboring cities 7 Am I stacking too many filters at once? Seniority + industry + years + education + language = death Temporarily remove 12 filters and see if real people appear 4 Flip the Angle 4560 seconds 8 Have I tried another search angle? From skill-based to company-based: \"Show me people at 510 target companies doing something close\" Or from title-only to skill + environment: \"GMP + bioconjugation + 'lab'\" instead of just job titles 9 Did I look at who's already in process for similar roles? Reuse patterns: where did those people come from? which titles? 5 Escalate or Reset 30 seconds 10 If after trying the above it's still bad: › Drop 23 screenshots of the best you can find into Teams/Slack › Message: \"This is what the market is giving us with current must-haves. To open it up, we might need to flex on X or Y. Can we discuss?\" 💡 Remember: Sometimes it's not a search problem , it's a requirements problem and that's part of the job too. Use These Every Time Pre-search keeps you focused. Stuck-search gets you unstuck. Both save hours of wasted effort. ← Back to 20% Search Craft Framework Overview",

AI helps draft fast, humans validate what matters. Goal Everyone can reliably find the right people without needing a \"Boolean hero.\" ⏱️ Timebox 10 minutes solo + 5 minutes with HM 🎯 Output Role DNA, title map, starter search string 🤖 AI role Draft → suggest synonyms → widen/narrow safely Core Skills (with “How to Use It”) 1) Role DNA (must-haves vs flex) How to do it (AI-first): Paste the JD + intake notes into AI to draft the Role DNA. You edit it (remove fluff, confirm must-haves). 5-minute HM reality-check : agree flex zones and deal-breakers. ✅ Template (keep it realistic) Must-haves (5–10) : skills/experience that define “qualified” Nice-to-haves (3–6) : add value but not required Context (5–8) : domain, environment, constraints Flex zones (3–5) : what you can compromise on If you need 50 bullets, the role is unclear — not the search. 📋 Copy-ready AI prompt Act as a recruiter + sourcing strategist. Create a Role DNA for this role using ONLY the inputs below. Output exactly: 1) Must-haves (5–10) 2) Nice-to-haves (3–6) 3) Context (5–8) 4) Flex zones (3–5) 5) Deal-breakers (max 3) 6) 8–12 search keywords/synonyms Inputs: - Job description: [PASTE] - Intake notes / manager comments: [PASTE] Why this matters Role DNA becomes your search brief, your AI prompt, and your HM reality-check. It prevents “searching beautifully for the wrong thing.” 2) Titles & synonyms (don’t miss hidden matches) How to do it: Start with 8–12 titles (seniority variations included) Add 6–10 hidden titles (same work, different label) Validate 2–3 by checking real profiles or job ads 🔎 Quick title map Base title: Scientist Levels: Associate / Senior / Principal / Lead Adjacent labels: Engineer / Specialist / Research Associate Domain tags: ADC / bioconjugation / oligo / mRNA 🤖 AI prompt (titles) Give me alternative job titles for this Role DNA. Rules: - Return a table: Title | Typical seniority | Notes - Include hidden titles (how companies rename the same work) - Include synonyms across EU/US naming where relevant Role DNA: [PASTE] Result You stop missing great candidates just because their job title is weird. 3) Simple Boolean (coverage + clarity) Rule of thumb Use Boolean to group synonyms and avoid obvious mismatches — not to build a 12-line monster string. 🧱 Starter skeleton (title:([TITLE_1] OR [TITLE_2] OR [TITLE_3])) AND ([SKILL_1] OR [SKILL_2] OR [SKILL_3]) AND ([LOCATION_1] OR [LOCATION_2]) NOT ([OBVIOUS_MISMATCH_1] OR [OBVIOUS_MISMATCH_2]) Start broad, then narrow based on what the results actually show. ✅ Example (clear and usable) (title:(\"Scientist\" OR \"Research Associate\" OR \"Bioconjugation Scientist\")) AND (\"bioconjugation\" OR \"ADC\" OR \"antibody-drug conjugate\") AND (\"Darmstadt\" OR \"Frankfurt\" OR \"Hesse\") NOT (\"student\" OR \"intern\") Focus: coverage and clarity, not clever tricks. 💡 Make it repeatable: save “starter skeletons” in a shared doc / Sheet as starter packs. For a new role, swap titles/skills/geo. 4) Search QA (fix the search before blaming the market) Mini QA checklist (2 minutes) Have I included title synonyms + seniority variations? Am I over-filtering location or industry? Do I need to widen skills (tools vs outcomes)? Did I accidentally exclude the target companies? 🤖 AI prompt (QA) Here is my Role DNA + my current search string. Suggest 3 changes to widen results and 3 changes to narrow results. Explain the trade-offs of each suggestion. Role DNA: [PASTE] Current search: [PASTE] Goal: [e.g. more mid-level, fewer academics, more industry] S3 Search QA Clinic (45 min monthly) In the session Each sourcer brings: 2–3 searches that didn’t work well 2–3 job ads/profiles that were “wrong” (too senior, wrong background, etc.) As a group, we diagnose: What’s missing (titles, synonyms, skills, context)? What’s too narrow (location/industry/filters)? What’s the simplest change that improves signal? We then update the team library with improved versions. How we use it afterwards If a search is painful, it becomes a candidate for next clinic , not a private struggle.

Why These Frameworks Matter These aren't just copywriting tricks they're tested structures that help you write messages people actually read and respond to. Start with the basics first (Bar Test, 3-Line Outreach, Jargon Swap), then level up with these. 1 AIDA Attention Interest Desire Action For: Job ads, LinkedIn posts, outreach where you need to \"pull\" someone in step by step Idea: Don't start with \"We have an exciting opportunity.\" Start with something that hooks attention, then slowly earn the right to ask for action. Attention Hook, pattern break Interest Relevant to them Desire What life looks like Action Clear next step Outreach Example: A: \"Most scientists I speak with are drowning in lab work and still stuck in old equipment.\" I: \"Your experience in biologics + setting up new methods really stood out you're basically already doing half of what this team needs.\" D: \"This role gives you modern kit, budget, and a lead scientist who actually listens when you push for change.\" A: \"If you're open, I can send 3 bullet points. A 'no' is also completely fine.\" 2 PAS Problem Agitate Solution For: Cold outreach and job ads that speak to pain points (burnout, stuck roles, zero growth, chaos) Idea: People move to get away from pain just as much as to chase something better. Problem Name what's hurting Agitate Dig deeper Solution Show the way out Outreach Example: P: \"A lot of senior sourcers tell me they're treated like CV machines.\" A: \"No say in role design, no real partnership with hiring managers just 'send more profiles'.\" S: \"I'm working with a team where sourcers push back, influence the process, and get measured on quality, not volume. Want a 10-min chat to see if it's your kind of environment?\" 3 BAB Before After Bridge For: LinkedIn posts, storytelling in outreach, \"why this role\" parts of job ads Idea: Show the transformation how life looks now vs. how it could look. Before Current reality After Improved reality Bridge The path Job Ad Intro Example: Before: \"Right now you're probably juggling experiments, firefighting, and reporting to three different people.\" After: \"Imagine one clear scope, a PI who shields you from noise, and time to actually think about your data.\" Bridge: \"That's the setup in this Senior Scientist role in Darmstadt.\" 4 FAB Features Advantages Benefits For: Turning boring job bullet points into candidate-relevant benefits Idea: Nobody cares that you have \"modern lab infrastructure.\" They care what that does for them. Feature The thing Advantage Why it's better Benefit What it changes Example: F: \"On-site, state-of-the-art bioconjugation lab.\" A: \"You don't wait weeks for access or queue for basic equipment.\" B: \"You get to run more of your ideas, not just chase backlog.\" \"Access to modern facilities\" \"You'll work in a modern bioconjugation lab, which means less waiting, more time running your own experiments, and faster turnaround on results.\" 5 WIIFM \"What's In It For Me?\" Filter For: EVERYTHING - Outreach, job ads, InMails, LinkedIn posts, HM emails Idea: Every line should answer one of their questions, not yours. For candidates, WIIFM = Will my work matter? Will this help my career? Will my life be better (money, time, stress, learning)? Will I be treated decently? How to use it: 1. Write your message 2. Ask: \"If I were the candidate, what do I get from this?\" 3. If the answer is \"company branding / blah-blah,\" rewrite. \"We are a leading global organization offering a competitive package.\" \"You'd join a small team inside a big company lots of stability, but you still know everyone you work with by name.\" 6 4U's Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific For: Subject lines, first lines of InMails, job ad headings, LinkedIn hooks Idea: You don't need all 4 every time but aim for 23. Useful \"What do I get?\" Urgent \"Why now?\" Unique \"Why different?\" Ultra-specific Numbers, detail Subject Line Examples: \"Bioconjugation role where you design the strategy, not just follow it\" (Useful + Unique) \"2-liner about a role that fixes the 'no time for real science' problem\" (Useful + Ultra-specific) \"Quick question about your move after your PhD\" (Useful + Urgent + Specific) 7 HSO Hook Story Offer For: LinkedIn posts, outreach that feels like a micro-story instead of a pitch Hook Strong opening Story Short anecdote Offer Invite, not sell LinkedIn Post Example: Hook: \"I don't care how smart your Boolean is if your candidate experience is trash.\" Story: \"Last month I spoke to a candidate who had 3 recruiters ghost her after final interview. She remembers their names. She will never take their calls again. Our tools are getting smarter. Our behavior? Not always.\" Offer: \"If you lead a team, your edge in 2025 is not 'more reach' it's 'better follow-through'. Happy to share how we're trying to fix this in our",

Example: \"Let's be honest: this isn't a 9 to 5. But you get real ownership and a manager who actually backs you.\" 3 Obvious Fix What is the simple way this role/team actually improves that? Example: \"This team gives you protected time for your own experiments, not just service work.\" 4 Obvious Proof What is one concrete fact / example that shows it's real, not marketing? Example: \"The last scientist we hired published 2 papers in their first year from their own ideas, not assigned projects.\" 5 Obvious Next Step What's the smallest, clearest next step? Example: \"Reply 'yes' or 'no', or I can send you 3 bullet points so you can decide in 30 seconds.\" Rule of Thumb: If your message doesn't hit at least 3 of these 5 , it's probably fluff. Updated Copywriting Cheat-Sheet (with Obvious Adams) How Obvious Adams fits with other frameworks Framework 3-4 Word Summary 1-Line Example When To Use AIDA Hook Warm Ask \"Most lab scientists are buried in routine this role gives time for your ideas.\" Outreach, Job ads, LinkedIn PAS Pain Twist Fix \"Tired of 'send more CVs'? This team wants sourcers who push back.\" Outreach, Job ads, LinkedIn BAB Before After Bridge \"Juggling chaos now; focused scope here let me show you.\" Outreach, Job ads, LinkedIn FAB Feature Why So-What \"Modern lab = less waiting = more time for your experiments.\" Job ads, HM decks, Follow-up WIIFM What's In It For Me \"Move from firefighting to focused work with manager who protects your time.\" EVERYWHERE 4U's Useful / Urgent / Unique / Specific \"2-liner about a role where you design strategy, not follow it.\" Subject lines, Hooks HSO Hook Story Offer \"Boolean means nothing if candidate experience is broken.\" LinkedIn posts, Branding PASTOR Problem Story Transform \"TA leads stuck; one flipped it in 18 months; want the story?\" Senior roles, Long posts Obvious Adams Say The Obvious Truth \"Let's be honest: this isn't a 95, but you get real ownership of the portfolio and a manager who actually backs you in front of the business.\" Final edit/filter on all comms (Outreach, JDs, HM, LinkedIn) Concrete Before/After with Obvious Adams Scenario: Outreach to a senior scientist BEFORE (typical recruiter fluff): \"I'd love to present you with an exciting opportunity at a leading global organization. We offer a competitive package and a dynamic environment.\" Run Obvious Adams: Obvious Problem? candidate is tired of vague promises, no clarity Obvious Truth? job will be demanding, but growth + ownership are real Obvious Fix? clearer scope, better manager, less chaos Obvious Proof? small team, real examples, not just buzzwords Obvious Next Step? small, easy: \"can send 3 bullets / say no\" AFTER (Obvious Adams version): \"Let me be straight: this isn't a chill 95. You'd own a tough portfolio but you'd also get a manager who shields you from nonsense and actually backs your decisions. If you want, I can send 3 bullet points so you can decide in 30 seconds if it's worth a chat.\" Result: Same role, totally different trust signal. How to Use Obvious Adams 1 Write First Use any framework (AIDA, PAS, etc.) to write your message 2 Apply the Filter Run through the 5 Obvious Questions hit at least 3 3 Simplify & Send Cut corporate speak, say the obvious truth, make it human Key Principle: If you wouldn't say it to someone over coffee, don't write it in an email.

      "content": "⏳ What AI Cannot Change The Timeless Truths of Great Recruiting In a world obsessed with the next AI tool, the best recruiters focus on what will never change. The Bezos Principle \"I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' That is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' \" \"And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two — because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time.\" — Jeff Bezos For Amazon, it's low prices, fast delivery, and wide selection. For recruiting, it's trust , relationships , honesty , and the human element . These will never change. What Changes vs. What Stays 🔄 What Changes (Tools & Tech) ⏳ What Won't Change (Human Needs) Sourcing tools and platforms Candidates want to be treated with respect Automation of outreach People hire people they trust AI-generated messages Quality relationships compound over time Speed of screening Hiring managers want reliable, quality hires Data-driven decisions Candidates remember how you made them feel Boolean and search syntax Honesty and transparency always win The 8 Timeless Principles 1 Trust Is The Currency The Foundation of Every Hire Candidates and hiring managers remember how you made them feel long after they forget what tools you used. Trust is built in small moments: returning calls, being honest about timelines, following through on promises. Ask yourself: Would I trust myself if I were the candidate? 2 Speed + Quality, Not Just Speed Fast Is Meaningless Without Good AI makes everything faster. But fast garbage is still garbage. The best recruiters use speed to create more time for quality conversations, deeper assessments, and better matches — not just more volume. Use AI speed to invest more time where it matters: human judgment. 3 Relationships Compound Today's Rejected Candidate Is Tomorrow's Hiring Manager Every interaction is an investment. The candidate you reject today may become a client in 3 years, or refer the perfect hire next month. Treat every person as a long-term relationship, not a transaction. Leave every interaction with someone who would recommend you. 4 Honesty Beats Spin \"I Don't Know\" Is Better Than Corporate Fluff Candidates can smell BS from a mile away. \"I don't know, but I'll find out\" builds more trust than polished corporate speak. Be direct about challenges, honest about timelines, and real about what the job actually involves. Apply the Obvious Adams test: Would a real person say this? 5 Respect Everyone's Time A Quick No Is Better Than Silent Maybe Time is the ultimate currency. Ghosting candidates, slow feedback, endless interview loops — these destroy trust instantly. A respectful \"no\" in 24 hours is infinitely better than silence for 3 weeks. Set expectations early, update often, close the loop always. 6 Craft Never Dies Good Writing, Good Listening, Good Judgment AI can generate content, but craft is human. The ability to write a message that actually connects, to listen deeply in a conversation, to make judgment calls on cultural fit — these skills become more valuable as AI handles the routine. Invest in the skills AI can't replicate: empathy, judgment, creativity. 7 Context Over Templates Understanding Beats Automation The best recruiters understand why a role matters, not just what it requires. They understand a candidate's career arc, not just their current title. Context enables personalization that no template can match. Before you automate, ask: Do I actually understand this? 8 Humans Hire Humans AI Assists, But The Decision Is Human At the end of every process, a human makes a decision about another human. AI can filter, score, suggest — but the judgment about who joins a team, who fits a culture, who will thrive, remains fundamentally human. Use AI to get to the human conversation faster, not to replace it. 🧪 The Timeless Test Before adopting any new AI tool, process, or approach, ask: \"Will candidates and hiring managers still want this in 10 years?\" ✓ If YES Double down. Build systems around it. Train your team on it. ✗ If NO It's a tactic, not a strategy. Use it, but don't depend on it. How This Connects These timeless principles are the foundation of everything we teach. They're embedded in our frameworks: ⚖️ 20-30-50 Framework 50% Human & Brand exists because relationships and trust will always matter most. 💡 Obvious Adams Honesty and clarity will always beat corporate speak and spin. ✍️ Copywriting Good writing is craft. Craft never dies. Focus on What Won't Change Tools will evolve. Platforms will rise and fall. But the fundamentals of human connection remain constant. Build your career on the timeless, and the technology will take care of itself. ← Back to Frameworks Hub Home",

      "content": "🤖 What is AI? A simple, jargon-free explanation of Artificial Intelligence Let's Start Simple Imagine you have a really smart assistant who never gets tired, can read thousands of books in seconds, and is always ready to help. That's essentially what AI is - a computer program that can think and help solve problems, just like a human would, but much faster. 💡 Think of AI Like a Super-Smart Calculator A calculator helps you with math. AI helps you with thinking tasks - like writing emails, finding information, or making decisions. Just like you type numbers into a calculator, you type questions or requests into AI. What Can AI Actually Do? ✍️ Writing & Communication • Write emails and messages • Create job descriptions • Summarize long documents • Translate languages 🔍 Research & Analysis • Find information quickly • Analyze data and trends • Compare options • Generate ideas 🎯 Problem Solving • Answer complex questions • Suggest solutions • Help make decisions • Plan projects ⚡ Automation • Organize information • Create templates • Schedule tasks • Generate reports Key Things to Remember ✅ AI is a Tool, Not Magic Just like a hammer helps you build things, AI helps you think and work faster. It's not mysterious - it's just very advanced software. ✅ You're Still in Control AI gives you suggestions and help, but you decide what to use. Think of it as a very smart colleague who gives advice. ✅ It Gets Better With Practice The more you use AI and learn how to ask it questions, the more helpful it becomes. It's like learning to use any new tool. Let's Clear Up Some Myths ❌ Myth: \"AI will replace my job\" Reality: AI is designed to help you do your job better and faster, not replace you. Think of it as getting a super-powered assistant. ❌ Myth: \"You need to be technical to use AI\" Reality: Using AI is as simple as having a conversation. If you can send a text message, you can use AI. ❌ Myth: \"AI is always right\" Reality: AI makes mistakes just like humans do. Always double-check important information and use your judgment. A Real Example from Your Work 📧 Writing a Professional Email ❌ Without AI (Old Way): • Spend 15 minutes thinking about what to write • Write, delete, rewrite several times • Worry about tone and professionalism • Ask a colleague to review it • Total time: 30+ minutes ✅ With AI (New Way): • Tell AI: \"Write a professional email to schedule an interview\" • AI creates a draft in 10 seconds • You review and adjust as needed • Send with confidence • Total time: 3-5 minutes 🎉 Great Job! You Now Understand AI Basics You've learned that AI is simply a powerful tool that can help you work smarter and faster.

      "content": "Module 2 of 5 8 min read 💬 Your First AI Conversation Learn how to \"talk\" to AI and get amazing results Think of AI as a Helpful Colleague Imagine you're talking to a really smart coworker who wants to help you. You wouldn't just say \"Help me\" - you'd explain what you need. The same is true with AI. The better you explain what you want, the better help you'll get. 💡 The Golden Rule of AI Be specific, be clear, and be polite. AI responds best when you give it clear instructions, just like a human would. The Simple Formula for Great AI Conversations 📝 The Basic Formula: 1. What you want: \"Write an email...\" 2. Who it's for: \"...to a job candidate...\" 3. The purpose: \"...to schedule an interview\" 4. The tone: \"...in a friendly, professional tone\" Let's See This in Action 📧 Example 1: Writing a Professional Email Write an email to a job candidate named Sarah to schedule an interview for a Marketing Manager position. Make it friendly but professional, and suggest 3 time slots next week. Subject: Interview Invitation - Marketing Manager Position Dear Sarah, Thank you for your interest in the Marketing Manager position at our company. We were impressed with your application and would like to invite you for an interview. Would any of these times work for you? • Tuesday, March 14th at 2:00 PM • Wednesday, March 15th at 10:00 AM • Friday, March 17th at 3:00 PM The interview will take approximately 45 minutes and will be conducted via video call. Please let me know which time works best for you. Looking forward to speaking with you! Best regards, [Your Name] Why this worked: The request was specific (email type, recipient, purpose, tone) and included all necessary details. 🔍 Example 2: Getting Research Help I need to find candidates for a Software Developer role. Can you help me create a list of skills and qualifications I should look for? Focus on mid-level developers, not entry-level or senior. Here's a comprehensive list for mid-level Software Developer candidates: Technical Skills (Required): • 3-5 years of programming experience • Proficiency in at least 2 programming languages • Experience with databases (SQL/NoSQL) • Understanding of version control (Git) • Knowledge of testing frameworks Soft Skills: • Problem-solving abilities • Team collaboration • Communication skills • Adaptability to new technologies Nice to Have: • Cloud platform experience • Agile/Scrum methodology • API development experience Why this worked: Clear request with specific level (mid-level) and context (what it's for). Do's and Don'ts for AI Conversations ✅ DO These Things • Be specific about what you want • Include context and background • Specify the tone or style you need • Ask follow-up questions if needed • Say \"please\" and \"thank you\" (it helps!) • Give examples when possible ❌ DON'T Do These • Be too vague (\"Help me with work\") • Assume AI knows your situation • Use only one-word requests • Get frustrated if first try isn't perfect • Share sensitive personal information • Expect AI to read your mind Let's Practice Together 🎯 Practice Scenarios Scenario 1: Job Description You need to write a job description for a Customer Service Representative. Try this prompt: \"Write a job description for a Customer Service Representative position. Include key responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications. Make it engaging and professional. The role is for a tech company and requires 2+ years of experience.\" Scenario 2: Interview Questions You need good interview questions for a sales role. Try this prompt: \"Create 10 interview questions for a Sales Associate position. Include a mix of behavioral and situational questions. Focus on customer service skills, sales experience, and problem-solving abilities.\" Key Takeaways 🎯 Be Specific The more details you provide, the better AI can help you. 🔄 Iterate If the first response isn't perfect, ask AI to adjust it. 💭 Think Context Always provide background information and context. 🎉 Excellent! You Can Now Talk to AI You've learned the fundamentals of communicating with AI effectively. Remember: be specific, provide context, and don't be afraid to ask for adjustments. Next up: Module 3 is where the fun begins! You'll get hands-on practice with real AI tools in a safe, guided environment. Back to Beginner Path Complete Module 2 → 🎉 Module 2 Completed!

Please think through this step by step: 1. First, evaluate their relevant experience 2. Then assess their communication skills based on the interview 3. Consider how well they match our company culture 4.

Think through this systematically: 1. Experience Analysis: Review their 5 years in digital marketing 2. Skill Assessment: Evaluate their campaign management experience 3. Cultural Fit: Consider their collaborative approach mentioned in interview 4. Growth Potential: Assess their leadership capabilities 5. Final Recommendation: Provide hire/no-hire with reasoning Candidate Profile: Sarah Chen, 5 years digital marketing experience, led 3 successful product launches, strong in data analysis, collaborative leadership style, seeking growth opportunities. AI Response: Let me analyze Sarah Chen systematically: 1. Experience Analysis: 5 years in digital marketing shows solid foundation.

Create 8 interview questions that will help assess both technical skills and cultural fit for a mid-level full-stack developer role. Include a mix of technical, behavioral, and situational questions. 📋 Technique 4: Prompt Templates Create reusable templates for common tasks. This ensures consistency and saves time.

The #1 Skill for Working with AI The goal today is to become an expert instructor for your AI assistant. In our survey, the #1 skill gap was knowing how to get the AI to do what you actually want. Think of AI as the world's most brilliant junior assistant: it's incredibly fast and knowledgeable, but it has zero context about your job. A vague instruction gets a vague result. An expert instruction gets an expert result. A Tale of Two Prompts The \"Before\" Prompt This is how most people start. The result is generic, boring, and won't attract top talent because the AI has to guess everything. write a job description for a software engineer The \"After\" Prompt (C.R.E.A.T.E.) This is an expert command. It gives the AI a professional brief, not a vague question, leading to a high-quality result. [CHARACTER] You are an expert RPO recruiter and recruitment marketer... [REQUEST] Write a compelling job description for a \"Senior Full-Stack Engineer\" tailored to mid-market tech companies... [EXAMPLES] Provide 3 short example bullets showing desired tone (concise, action-oriented, benefits-focused). [ADDITIONS] Include location, required experience (5+ years), and must-have stacks (React, Node.js). [TYPE] Output: Sections — Summary, Responsibilities, Required Skills, Nice-to-Have, Compensation Range, How to Apply. [EXTRAS] Tone: professional & persuasive; length: ~300 words; avoid buzzwords. The C.R.E.A.T.E. Framework An expert prompt contains six key ingredients. Mastering this structure is the key to getting high-quality results every time. Character Who should the AI be? Request What action should it perform? Examples What does a good output look like? Additions Extra context, constraints, or details Type Format / structure of the response Extras Tone, length, and items to avoid Lab Activities Lab 1: Creating a Candidate Persona (15 Mins) Your goal is to create a detailed candidate persona for a hard-to-fill \"Senior Clinical Research Associate\" role. If you don't know who you're looking for, you can't write content that resonates. Use the C.R.E.A.T.E. structure to build your prompt. View Example Persona Prompt [CHARACTER] You are a senior life sciences recruiter and candidate profiling expert... [REQUEST] Create a detailed candidate persona for a \"Senior Clinical Research Associate\" based in Budapest... [EXAMPLES] Provide sections and sample bullets (Summary, Demographics & Experience, Key Skills, Motivations, Where to Find Them). [ADDITIONS] Include typical certifications, seniority level, and travel expectations. [TYPE] Output: Headed sections with 3–5 bullets each. [EXTRAS] Tone: factual and recruiter-facing; keep concise. Lab 2: Drafting a Compelling Job Description (20 Mins) Now, use the persona you just created to draft a job description that speaks directly to them. This time, include Examples showing tone & structure in the prompt so the AI replicates it. View Example Job Description Prompt [CHARACTER] You are an expert recruitment marketing copywriter... [REQUEST] Write a full job description for a Senior CRA role targeting the persona we created... [EXAMPLES] Include a short sample opening paragraph that demonstrates the desired tone: \"Join us in a role that advances clinical innovation...\" [ADDITIONS] Include location, salary band (EUR mid-market), and required qualifications. [TYPE] Structure the output with headings: \"Your Mission\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Required Skills\", \"Benefits\". [EXTRAS] Tone: confident & inclusive; length: ~350 words; avoid buzzwords like \"rockstar\". Wrap-Up & Next Steps Your new superpower is the C.R.E.A.T.E. Framework. Remember the golden rule: Vague Instructions = Vague Results. Expert Instructions = Expert Results. Optional Homework: Take a real role you're working on now. Use the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework to create a persona and a draft outreach email. Next Session: Session 1.2 - AI-Powered Email & Content Lab. Next: Session 1.2",

      "content": "Session 1.2: AI-Powered Email & Content Lab Our Goal: To move beyond just drafting. Today, you will learn to use AI as your co-editor, creative partner, and summarizer for the most important writing you do: candidate outreach. We will learn to write better emails, faster — using the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework. Go Beyond the First Draft Think of the time spent perfecting an email's tone. Is it too formal? Too casual? Too long? AI is your secret weapon for refinement. You can use it for three key tasks: Tone & Style Modulation: Instantly change the feel of your message. Summarization: Condense long documents into punchy, effective emails. A/B Testing: Create variations to see what gets the best response. Example: Changing Your Tone Start with a standard sentence: \"We have an opening for a Senior Clinical Research Associate that I believe aligns with your professional background.\" Prompt 1: Make it more engaging Rewrite this sentence to be more energetic and direct using the C.R.E.A.T.E. structure (Character, Request, Examples, Additions, Type, Extras)... Result: \"I came across your profile and was immediately impressed... I'm hiring for a Senior CRA role that seems like a perfect match...\" Prompt 2: Make it more formal Rewrite this for a highly senior, executive-level candidate using the C.R.E.A.T.E. elements to guide tone and format... Result: \"Given your distinguished career... I am writing to introduce a Senior CRA opportunity that I believe may be of strategic interest to you.\" Example: The Power of Summarization Don't manually summarize a long job description ever again. Give the AI the document and tell it what you need. This is a massive time-saver. The Prompt: You are a busy RPO sourcer. Read the full job description below and summarize it into a 3-bullet point email for a passive candidate. The email should be short, intriguing, and end with a clear call to action. [Paste the entire job description text here] Lab Activities Lab 1: The Perfect Outreach Email (20 Mins) Your Goal: Combine everything we've learned to draft a complete, compelling outreach email from scratch using the full C.R.E.A.T.E. framework . You'll be reaching out to the \"Senior Clinical Research Associate\" persona from our last session. View Example Prompt Guide [CHARACTER] You are a highly professional and empathetic senior recruiter... [REQUEST] Draft a short, compelling outreach email to the \"Senior CRA\" persona that opens conversation and asks for a brief call... [EXAMPLES] Include a short sample opening paragraph that demonstrates the desired tone: \"I'm reaching out specifically because your deep experience in oncology trials is rare and highly valued.\" [ADDITIONS] Include location, a low-pressure call-to-action, and one sentence highlighting a key benefit of the role. [TYPE] The email should have three short paragraphs and a clear, low-pressure call to action. [EXTRAS] Tone: professional and warm; length: ~120–160 words; avoid buzzwords like \"rockstar\". Lab 2: The A/B Testing Challenge (15 Mins) Your Goal: Take your great email and make it even better by testing the most critical part: the subject line and opening sentence. View Example Prompts for Testing Prompt for Subject Lines: You are a world-class email marketing expert. For the email below, generate 5 alternative subject lines. They should be short, professional, and create a sense of curiosity. [Paste your full email draft here] Prompt for Opening Sentences: Now, do the same for the first sentence of the email. Generate 3 alternative opening sentences. One should be based on a shared connection, one on a specific skill, and one should be more direct. Use the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework to set context and desired tone. [Paste your full email draft here] Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your New Superpower: AI is your Co-Editor , not just your drafter. Use it to refine tone, summarize content, and brainstorm creative options — guided by the C.R.E.A.T.E. structure. The Golden Rule: Always be testing. Small changes in wording can lead to big changes in response rates. Next Session: Session 1.3 - Success Spotlight & Prompt Clinic #1. Next: Session 1.3",

We will see a real-world win from a peer and solve your real-world prompting challenges together, live. Success Spotlight #1 A Real-World Win from Anna The Problem: Anna was starting a search for a \"Head of Digital Marketing\" in a competitive fintech market. The old way involved hours of manual research on LinkedIn to understand the landscape. The New Way: She built one powerful prompt to do the work for her using the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework. Anna's Winning \"Talent Landscape Snapshot\" Prompt (C.R.E.A.T.E.) [CHARACTER] You are a senior market intelligence analyst for a top executive search firm, specializing in the European fintech sector. [REQUEST] Create a \"Talent Landscape Snapshot\" for the \"Head of Digital Marketing\" role for a fast-growing fintech startup in Budapest. [EXAMPLES] Show one short example of the desired heading structure and an example bullet for \"Target Companies\" (e.g., \"Company A — scale-up with strong performance marketing\"). [ADDITIONS] Include company size, market segment, and 2–3 likely senior job titles that compete for this hire. [TYPE] Format the output with headings: \"Target Companies,\" \"Common Job Titles,\" and \"Key Skills & Technologies\" — each with 3–8 bullets. [EXTRAS] Keep concise, recruiter-facing tone; avoid speculative claims; return sources or rationale where possible. The Impact: From Hours to Seconds The AI provided a perfectly formatted report in ~30 seconds. It identified target companies and more specific job titles like \"VP of Growth.\" It listed key technologies like \"HubSpot\" and \"Salesforce Marketing Cloud.\" This saved at least 1 hour of manual research and gave her a huge confidence boost. Live Prompt Clinic #1 Your Turn to Get Help The Rule: This is a \"no-judgment zone.\" If you're stuck, chances are someone else is too. We will fix prompts as a group. Clinic Case Study: Peter's Problem The Challenge: Peter wanted help writing screening questions for a \"Junior Accountant\" role, but his results were too generic. Peter's \"Before\" Prompt: Give me interview questions for a junior accountant. The Group's \"After\" Prompt (C.R.E.A.T.E.): [CHARACTER] You are a hiring manager experienced in screening entry-level finance candidates. [REQUEST] Generate interview questions for a \"Junior Accountant\". [EXAMPLES] Provide examples of behavioral and technical questions (e.g., \"Tell me about a time you found and fixed a spreadsheet error\"). [ADDITIONS] Key qualifications: attention to detail, Excel pivot tables experience, eagerness to learn; indicate desired seniority level and typical responsibilities. [TYPE] Organize questions into categories: \"Attention to Detail,\" \"Excel Skills,\" and \"Learning Agility\" with 4–6 questions per category. [EXTRAS] Include one suggested scoring rubric per category (1–5), and keep language concise and interviewer-friendly. The Result: From Generic to Perfectly Structured By adding Character, Additions (context) and Type (format), the AI produced specific, behavioral questions organized into the exact categories needed for a structured screening call. Peter got a ready-to-use list in minutes. Wrap-Up & Next Steps Your new superpower is realizing that learning is a team sport. Share your wins and don't be afraid to ask for help in our clinics.

      "content": "Session 2.1: AI for Advanced Sourcing Our Goal: To use AI to move beyond obvious keywords and become true market intelligence experts. We will find better candidates, faster. Part A: Boolean & Beyond Stop Brainstorming Keywords. Start Generating Them. The old way of writing a Boolean string is slow. You try to think of every possible synonym and job title. The new way is to tell the AI what you need and let it do the heavy lifting. The Evolution of a Search Prompt: Start with a simple idea: \"Software Engineer with Python.\" Ask AI to expand it: \"Give me a list of 20 alternative job titles and 30 related technical skills.\" Ask AI to build it: \"Using these titles and skills, build me a complex Boolean search string for LinkedIn.\" View the \"Boolean Builder\" Prompt Example [ROLE] You are an expert tech sourcer with deep knowledge of LinkedIn Recruiter's search syntax. [CONTEXT] I am looking for a \"Senior Software Engineer\" with experience in Python, AWS, and database management. I need to create a comprehensive search string to find candidates in the Budapest area. [TASK] First, brainstorm a list of 15 alternative job titles and 20 related technical skills for this role. Then, using all of those terms, build me a complex, multi-layered Boolean search string that is optimized for LinkedIn Recruiter. [FORMAT] Provide the brainstormed lists first, then provide the final Boolean string in a code block. Part B: AI as Your Research Assistant Answer Questions in Minutes, Not Hours. Sourcing isn't just about finding people; it's about understanding the market. AI can be your personal research analyst. Here are three key research prompts: 1. Market Mapping \"List the top 10 biotech companies specializing in gene therapy in the Boston area.\" 2. Competitor Analysis \"Who are the main competitors for Company X, and what are their typical software engineering job titles?\" 3. Rapid CV Analysis \"Summarize this CV and create a table comparing the candidate's experience against these 5 key requirements from the job description.\" View the CV Summarization Prompt Example [ROLE] You are a senior RPO recruiter tasked with quickly screening candidates against a job description. [CONTEXT] I have a candidate's CV and the job description for the role they applied for. I need a fast, objective summary of how well they match the key requirements. [TASK] Read the CV and the Job Description provided below. Create a table with three columns: \"Key Requirement,\" \"Evidence from CV,\" and \"Match Level (High/Medium/Low).\" [FORMAT] The output should be ONLY the table. --- [PASTE JOB DESCRIPTION HERE] --- [PASTE CANDIDATE CV HERE] --- Lab Activities Lab 1: The Boolean Builder (20 Mins) Your Goal: Create a comprehensive Boolean string for a niche, hard-to-fill role like \"Clinical Research Associate with Oncology experience.\" Work in your breakout groups. Use the prompt structure to build your own multi-layered prompt. Run the prompt in Gemini. Crucially: Test the resulting Boolean string in a real LinkedIn search! Lab 2: The 5-Minute Market Map (20 Mins) Your Goal: Quickly gather actionable intelligence on a specific market to inform your sourcing strategy. Choose a role and a city. Use research prompts to produce a one-page \"Market Snapshot.\" Your snapshot must include: top 5 target companies, 3-5 common job titles, and a summary of one sample profile. Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your new superpower is letting AI do the heavy lifting on Search Logic, Market Research, and Candidate Analysis. The golden rule is to use AI to automate the research so you can spend more time on the human parts of recruiting: strategy and engagement.

The Decision Framework A Simple 3-Step Process for Choosing the Right Tool 1 Check for Sensitive Data Is there ANY candidate, client, or internal data involved? If YES, you MUST use our secure, internal tool: Gemini. 2 Check for Integration Does the task need to connect with Docs, Gmail, or Sheets? If YES, Gemini for Google Workspace is the most efficient choice. 3 General Creative Tasks If you answered NO to the first two questions, a public tool like ChatGPT is an acceptable option for non-sensitive, creative brainstorming. Gemini's Strengths 1. Data Security (The #1 Priority) Everything we do stays within our secure Randstad Google environment. We are not sharing potentially sensitive client or job information with a public model. 2. Workflow Integration With one click, our work can be exported to Docs or drafted in Gmail. This is a huge efficiency gain. For 95% of our recruiting tasks, Gemini is the right choice. The Security Imperative: A Non-Negotiable Rule You must NEVER paste sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or Client Data into a public, non-approved AI tool. This includes names, emails, phone numbers, full CVs, client names, and project details. Doing so is a major data privacy and security risk. When in doubt, always default to our secure, internal platform. Lab Activity: \"Choose Your Tool\" Scenarios Scenario 1: You need to summarize your confidential interview notes about three candidates for a sensitive role with our top client. Which tool do you use? (Answer: Gemini) Scenario 2: You want to brainstorm some fun, catchy, generic slogans for a university career fair flyer. Which tool do you use? (Answer: Gemini) Scenario 3: You need to find a 30-minute slot for an interview with your candidate, two hiring managers, and one HR partner. Which tool do you use? (Answer: A specialized AI Scheduling Tool) Key Takeaways & Next Steps You now have a clear framework for choosing the right AI tool. The golden rule is Security First, Always.

      "content": "Session 2.3: Responsible AI & Final Showcase Our Goal: To cover the most important topic of becoming responsible and ethical AI users, and then to celebrate your progress with a final showcase. What is AI Bias? AI models learn from vast amounts of internet data. The problem is that this data reflects the world as it has been, including all of its historical and unconscious biases. If we're not careful, the AI can simply echo and amplify these past biases. Our job is to be the filter that ensures fairness and equity. Where Can Bias Hide in Recruiting? In Job Descriptions Using gendered language (e.g., \"rockstar,\" \"ninja,\" \"aggressive salesman\"). Listing overly specific requirements that might exclude diverse talent pools (e.g., a degree from only one specific university). In CV Summaries Over-emphasizing traditional career paths and overlooking non-traditional experience. Unintentionally associating certain names with certain skills based on biased training data. Your critical eye is the most important tool. Lab Example: Fixing the Prompt In the lab, we practice identifying and correcting potentially biased AI outputs by rewriting the prompt that created them. The Biased AI Output: \"We're looking for a digital native and recent graduate who is a true code ninja to join our young, energetic team.\" Potential Bias: Ageism (\"recent graduate,\" \"young\"), gendered language (\"ninja\"), excludes experienced candidates. The Corrected, Inclusive Prompt: Write a job description for a software developer role. The ideal candidate should be proficient with modern coding practices and passionate about collaborative teamwork. The tone should be inclusive, professional, and welcoming to candidates of all ages and experience levels. The Most Important Principle You are the \"Human in the Loop.\" AI is a powerful assistant, but it is not the decision-maker. You are the final editor, the final judge, and the final quality check. Your industry expertise and human judgment are what make this partnership work. Never Trust, Always Verify. Final Showcase: The Prompt-a-Thon! Time to celebrate your skills! Each team will present their single best prompt created during the training in a 2-3 minute pitch. We'll see the goal, the prompt, and the amazing result. After all presentations, we'll use a live poll to award the \"People's Choice Award\" for the most innovative and effective prompt! Phase 1 Complete & What's Next Congratulations!

Example 2: Extracting Data The Mess: A \"Notes\" column filled with long sentences. Extract all mentioned technical skills from the 'Notes' column and place them in a new 'Skills' column. Core Skill 2: Generating Insights Become a Data Detective Once your data is clean, you can start asking it questions. 1. Asking Direct Questions \"Which recruiter had the highest number of placements in Q2?\" 2. Finding Trends \"Show me the trend of time-to-fill over the last 6 months as a line chart.\" 3. Creating Visuals \"Create a pie chart showing the distribution of candidates by source.\" Lab Activities Lab 1: The Data Janitor (20 Mins) Your Goal: Clean and structure a messy, real-world-style dataset using only natural language prompts. Open the sample Google Sheet provided. Use Gemini prompts to clean at least three different columns. Create one new column by extracting information from another. Be ready to share your most effective cleaning prompt! Lab 2: The Data Detective (20 Mins) Your Goal: To answer three specific business questions from your newly cleaned dataset using only natural language prompts. What is the average time-to-fill for roles in Texas vs. California? Who are the top 3 candidate sources that lead to hires? Create a bar chart showing the number of hires per month for the last 6 months. Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your new superpower is the ability to turn any spreadsheet into an interactive dashboard. The golden rule is that clean data is the foundation for good insights. Use AI to automate the cleaning so you can focus on the analysis.

      "content": "Session 3.2: Building an Intelligent Knowledge Base (No-Code RAG) Let's ask a question that was impossible yesterday: What if you could \"talk\" to your entire team's history of CVs and interview notes? Today, we're going to build the tool that does exactly that. What is RAG? (The Simple Explanation) It stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and it sounds complicated, but the concept is simple. \"RAG is the process of giving a brilliant expert (the AI) your private library of documents to read before they answer your question.\" This ensures the answers are grounded in your data, not the public internet. It's secure, relevant, and incredibly powerful. The Power of RAG: Meet Your \"CV & Candidate Info Bot\" This is what our final product will be able to do. Imagine asking a chat bot these questions about your team's private CV database: \"Which candidates have experience with both Python and AWS?\" \"Summarize Jane Doe's experience and highlight her top 3 skills.\" \"Who is the most experienced project manager for a fintech role based in London?\" Today's Project: Build Your Bot This is a guided, hands-on lab. We will walk through every step together to create your first AI application. Part 1: The Build (20 Mins) We'll use a no-code tool (like Vertex AI Search) to create a secure \"Data Store\" and upload a provided set of 20-30 anonymized sample CVs. The system will then \"read\" and \"index\" this information. Part 2: The Test (40 Mins) Once indexing is complete, you'll get access to the chat interface for your bot. Your task is to complete the \"Scavenger Hunt\" to test its capabilities. Lab Task: The Scavenger Hunt Use the chat interface for the bot you just built to find the answers to these questions: Find all candidates with a PMP certification. Which candidates mention \"data analysis\" as a skill? Summarize the CV of the candidate named \"John Smith\". Who has more years of experience in management, \"Jane Doe\" or \"Peter Jones\"? Which candidate is the best fit for a role requiring experience in both marketing and e-commerce? Explain why. Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your new superpower is that you have just built one of the most powerful tools in modern AI: a secure application that can reason over your team's collective knowledge. The golden rule is that the power of RAG is its ability to ground AI in trusted, specific data. Next Module: Module 4 - Automating Recruiting Workflows. Next: Session 4.1",

      "content": "Session 4.1: Introduction to No-Code Automation Our Goal: To build a workflow that completely automates a boring task. Let's connect the dots and build a system that works for you, even when you're not looking. The \"Finished Product\" Demo See Where We're Going Imagine this hands-free workflow we are building today: An email with candidate feedback arrives in your Gmail and you give it a label. You do nothing else. A moment later, a new row appears in your tracking spreadsheet, automatically filled with the candidate's name, a one-sentence summary, and a sentiment score. How Does Automation Actually Work? APIs Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant. It's how different apps talk to each other, taking requests and returning data. Triggers This is the \"When this happens...\" part of the equation. For us, it's \"When a new email gets the label 'Candidate Feedback'...\" Actions This is the \"...Then do that\" part. For us, it's \"...run my script to analyze it and add it to the spreadsheet.\" Our Platform: Google Apps Script We will be using Google Apps Script. It's built into your Google account and is perfect for connecting Google products. It uses a simplified version of JavaScript. Don't worry! You do not need to be a coder. We will provide you with a well-commented code template. Your job is to understand the logic, not to write code from scratch. Lab Activity: The End-to-End Workflow (65 Mins) Your Goal: To build and test the full, automated workflow from email to spreadsheet. The Plan of Action: The Connection: Use the provided template to create a script and set up the trigger to read emails from Gmail. The AI: Add the Gemini API call to the script to analyze the email's content. The Destination: Add the final lines of code to populate your Google Sheet. The Test: Send a sample email to yourself, label it, and watch the magic happen! The \"Magic\" Prompt This is the key to making the workflow intelligent. This prompt forces the AI to give us back perfectly structured data that our spreadsheet can understand. From the following email text, extract the candidate's name, provide a one-sentence summary of the feedback, and classify the interviewer's sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Return this as a JSON object. Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your new superpower is that you didn't just run a script; you built a system. The golden rule is to identify the most repetitive, copy-paste parts of your job, as these are the perfect candidates for automation. Next Module: Module 5 - Train the Trainer & Project Showcase.

This session is about the final, most important step: learning how to share that knowledge. You are now the AI leaders for your team. Your role is to empower, guide, and support. The Mentor Mindset Coach, Don't Just Tell The biggest shift you will make is from being the \"expert with the answers\" to becoming an \"enabler of others' success.\" Telling \"Here, let me just write the prompt for you.\" Result: Solves one problem, but doesn't build skill. Coaching \"That's a great question. What have you tried so far?\" Result: Builds your colleague's confidence and problem-solving ability. Your goal is to make yourself redundant. Teach them how to fish. The \"Ask, Don't Tell\" Model in Action Instead of giving the answer, use these guiding questions to help your colleagues find their own solution. \"What's the ideal output you're looking for?\" \"What's the most important piece of context the AI might be missing?\" \"If you were to give the AI a role, what would it be?\" \"What have you tried so far, and what were the results?\" How to Lead a Great Prompt Clinic When a colleague is stuck, use this simple 5-step framework to guide a group problem-solving session. 1. Set the Stage: Start by saying, \"This is a no-judgment zone. Let's solve this together.\" 2. Understand the Goal: Let the person explain what they want to achieve. 3. Open the Floor: Ask the group, \"What ideas does the team have?\" 4. Guide, Don't Drive: Help the user refine their own prompt based on the group's feedback. 5. Summarize the Win: End with, \"Great! The key change that worked here was adding more context.\" Lab Activities Lab 1: Mock Prompt Clinic (20 Mins) Your Goal: To practice facilitating a problem-solving session in a safe environment. Break out into small groups. Each person takes a turn leading a 10-minute mini-clinic. Focus on the process of facilitation, not just the technical answer. Lab 2: Brainstorming Responses (15 Mins) Your Goal: To collectively brainstorm effective and reassuring responses to common concerns like \"I don't have time for this.\" Focus on benefits, starting small, and offering support. Example: \"I felt that way too at first, but let me show you one trick that saved me 30 minutes yesterday.\" Key Takeaways & Next Steps Your new superpower is that you are now a coach and a facilitator. Your success is now measured by the success of those you help. Empower, guide, and support. The Final Step: Session 5.2 - The Capstone Project Showcase.

Our goal is to collaboratively build the strategic map that will guide our team's AI efforts for the next year, ensuring we invest in projects that deliver maximum business value. The Strategic Foundation Connecting Capabilities to Business Goals 1. Our Team's Proven Capabilities We'll review the successful projects from the Phase 2 \"AI Champions\" showcase (e.g., the CV Bot, automated workflows). These are the tools we know we can build. 2. Our Department's Business Objectives We'll review our key goals for the year (e.g., reduce time-to-fill by 15%, improve source-of-hire quality, etc.). The Key Question for Today: \"How can we apply our proven AI capabilities to directly accelerate our most important business objectives?\" Workshop Part 1: Opportunity Mapping Brainstorming Across the Recruiting Lifecycle The Goal: To create a comprehensive list of all potential AI projects. The Activity: Using a digital whiteboard, we will map out the entire RPO lifecycle: Intake → Sourcing → Screening → Submitting → Scheduling → Onboarding For each stage, we will brainstorm answers to two questions: What are our biggest pain points or bottlenecks in this stage? How could an AI tool or automation help solve them? The Prioritization Tool: The Impact vs. Effort Matrix Not all ideas are created equal. We will use this simple but powerful matrix to prioritize our list and spark crucial strategic conversations about value versus resources. Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort) Do these now! Major Projects (High Impact / High Effort) Plan for these. Fill-ins (Low Impact / Low Effort) Consider these later. Thankless Tasks (Low Impact / High Effort) Avoid these. From a Map to a Plan Workshop Part 2: Prioritizing The Goal: To create a prioritized visual map of all brainstormed ideas. As a leadership team, we will collectively discuss each idea from the Opportunity Mapping exercise and place it onto the Impact/Effort matrix. Workshop Part 3: Building the Roadmap The Goal: To select our top projects and create a clear, sequenced plan of action. We will identify the top 3-5 initiatives from the \"Quick Wins\" and \"Major Projects\" quadrants and sequence them on a simple timeline (e.g., Q3, Q4, Next Q1). Key Takeaways & Next Steps What We've Achieved Today: A shared vision for AI in our department. A comprehensive list of potential opportunities. A prioritized list of our top 3-5 projects. A draft roadmap for the next 6-9 months. This is our strategic foundation. Next Session: Session 7.1 - The ROI of AI in Recruiting. We will focus on defining how we will measure the success and calculate the ROI for these specific projects. Next: Session 7.1",

      "content": "Session 7.1: The ROI of AI in Recruiting A Strategic Workshop for RPO Leadership. Our goal is to build a data-driven, compelling business case for our top-priority project, turning our strategic ideas into funded, measurable projects. Defining Success What Does \"Good\" Look Like? Moving Beyond Anecdotes Leading Indicators These are the early signals of progress that show we're on the right track. Recruiter time saved per week Number of qualified candidates sourced via an AI tool Lagging Indicators These are the long-term business impact metrics that prove the value of our work. Reduction in average time-to-fill Improvement in 6-month new-hire retention We need a mix of both to tell the full story of our success. Calculating ROI: The Two Sides of Value Hard ROI: The Financial Case This is the quantifiable, bottom-line impact. It's the number that gets budgets approved. Formula: (Time Saved) x (# of People) x (Avg. Salary) = $$$ Saved Soft ROI: The Strategic Case This is the harder-to-measure but equally important strategic value that drives long-term success. Improved candidate quality Higher hiring manager satisfaction Enhanced team morale & retention The Simple Math of Hard ROI A Conservative Calculation Example The Project: Automating the summarization of interview feedback. The Assumption: This saves each of our 20 recruiters an average of 2 hours per week. The Calculation: 20 recruiters x 2 hours/week = 40 hours saved per week. 40 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 2,000 hours saved per year. 2,000 hours x [Average Recruiter Hourly Rate] = $X in annual productivity gain. This is a powerful, conservative number to anchor your business case. Workshop Activities Part 1: KPI Mapping (30 Mins) Select your #1 project from the roadmap and answer: \"If this project is a massive success one year from now, what 3-4 numbers on our dashboard will have changed?\" Define at least two \"hard\" and one \"soft\" metric. Part 2: Building the Business Case (30 Mins) Draft a concise, one-page business case for your chosen project using the provided template. The template will include: Problem Statement, Proposed AI Solution, Key Metrics (KPIs), Estimated ROI, and Required Resources. Part 3: Peer Review & Final Refinement (15 Mins) In pairs, present your one-page business cases to each other. Your partner's job is to act as a skeptical leader: ask tough questions, point out weaknesses, and help you strengthen your argument. From Vision to Action Plan After today, you will have a clear set of KPIs, a defensible method for calculating ROI, and a drafted, peer-reviewed business case for your top priority. You are now fully prepared to present your vision to GBS leadership. The Final Step: The Capstone Presentation. You will now formalize these plans into a final presentation to secure the resources needed to make our AI strategy a reality. Back to RPO Training",
